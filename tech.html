    <h2>Fertilizers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fertilizers are substances added to soil to enhance the growth of plants and improve soil quality.</li>
      <li>They contain essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that plants need to thrive.</li>
      <li>Organic fertilizers are made from natural sources, such as compost, manure, and bone meal.</li>
      <li>Inorganic fertilizers, also known as synthetic fertilizers, are made from chemical compounds.</li>
      <li>The use of fertilizers can increase crop yields and improve the nutritional value of plants, but overuse can
        lead to environmental problems such as pollution and soil degradation. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Technique</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are various techniques used to apply fertilizers, such as broadcasting, banding, and foliar spraying.
      </li>
      <li>Broadcasting involves spreading fertilizer over a large area and is commonly used in agriculture.</li>
      <li> Banding involves placing fertilizer in a concentrated band near the plant roots.</li>
      <li> Foliar spraying involves spraying fertilizer directly on the leaves of a plant.</li>
      <li>Precision fertilization is a technique that uses sensors and mapping technology to target specific areas of a
        field with the right amount of fertilizer.</li>
      <li> No-till farming is a technique that reduces soil erosion and retains nutrients by leaving crop residue on the
        field instead of tilling the soil.
      </li>
    </ul>
